# Project Status — Soups Unified Launcher (SUL)

**Last updated:** 2026-10-26 (Step 1.5: feature recovery and consolidation)

## Decisions made (owner approved)
- Stack: Tauri 2 + Rust core + React/TypeScript UI. Windows first. (`docs/decisions/0001-stack.md`)
- Step 1.5 (`docs/decisions/0002-step-1-5-consolidation.md`): the long-term `PROJECT_SPEC.md` governs; app identifier stays
  `app.soups.unifiedlauncher`; the per-game tick-and-compatibility matrix is kept with the five status labels derived from it;
  Discord small-image asset key is supported, a scale slider is not offered.
- Still open: licence, manifest schema migration policy, social/networking, Medal access level, first full game adapter.

## What exists
`crates/sul-core` (Rust): registry game scanner (Steam libraries on every drive, GOG, Uninstall keys, drive probing) behind
`RegistryAccess` / `FileSystem` seams; per-game compatibility matrix with the five capability labels derived from it; persisted
library index; storage isolator; baseline tracking and version self-updater with rollback; portable mode; JSON templates;
capability model with the evidence rule; safe paths; protected roots, atomic write, isolated copy; recovery journal; redacting JSONL
logger; SHA-256 build manifests; Discord Rich Presence over local IPC (opt-in); read-only Steam helpers (`steam://` launch URL,
build id and update policy recorded, Steam-library guard).
`src-tauri`: Tauri container, least-privilege capabilities, `app_info` and `discord_set_enabled` commands.
`ui`: Vite + React shell with the Step 1 sidebar (Game Library first; Settings and General Playtime Tracker last), the ten
roadmap modules as labelled placeholders, Team27 theme with contrast-checked token editor, backgrounds, borderless title bar,
splash, Discord Settings panel, capability legend with the "weakest status wins" headline rule.

## Verified (actually run, this session)
Linux container, Node 22, cargo 1.97. Exact commands and results:
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` → clean.
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` → clean.
- `cargo test --workspace` → 139 passed, 0 failed (105 `sul-core` unit tests, 13 in `tests/core.rs`, 15 in `tests/discord.rs`,
  5 in `tests/steam.rs`, 1 in `sul-tauri`).
- `npm run ui:typecheck` → clean. `npm run ui:test` → 33 passed, 0 failed. `npm run ui:build` → built (44 modules).

## Verified in GitHub Actions (run 40276520399, commit 04c968f, windows-latest)
- `core`: `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo clippy -p sul-core --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test -p sul-core` all passed.
  This is the first build of the merged code on Windows, including the Windows-only `WindowsRegistry` and `FixedDrives`.
- `ui`: `npm ci`, `npm run ui:typecheck`, `npm test --workspace ui`, `npm run ui:build` all passed.
- `tauri-shell`: `npm run ui:build`, `cargo clippy -p sul-tauri --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test -p sul-tauri` passed.
- Per-test counts for this run were not read (job and step results only).

## Verified earlier by the owner (before the merge, on the Step 1 archive, Windows)
- Registry scanner archive: 78 tests passed and 38 games were mapped. That run predates this merge and used the scanner on its own.
  Whether all 38 are correct, or whether games were missed, was not checked against a list.

## NOT verified
- The merged build has not been run by the owner on Windows (only CI built and tested it). The scanner's real-machine result for the
  merged code is unconfirmed.
- The desktop app has not been launched from this branch (`npm run dev`). The borderless title-bar buttons and the move from
  `withGlobalTauri` to `@tauri-apps/api` have never run inside a real Tauri window.
- Discord against a live Discord client; any of this against a real game install beyond the owner's scan; no game adapter exists.
- Helldivers 2 7.1.1 isolation/offline launch: Not investigated.
- Icons are the Team27 set, not reviewed as final branding. Wallpaper JPEGs are git-ignored (licences unconfirmed; docs in
  `ui/public/wallpapers/README.md`), so the gallery is empty on a fresh clone.
- The Step 1 spec's persistent Steam credentials and Direct3D/Vulkan overlay hooks conflict with `CLAUDE.md` (no secrets in source or
  logs, no anti-cheat bypass); not started, to be settled when those steps come up.

## Branch and safety net
- `step-1.5` was merged into `main` by fast-forward (9ece116 → 04c968f) at the owner's request; both branches are on GitHub.
  The legacy state is commit `9ece116`, tagged locally as `legacy-pre-step-1.5`. Pushing that tag was refused (HTTP 403) from the
  authoring session, so it is not on GitHub; see `docs/decisions/0002-step-1-5-consolidation.md`.

## Wipeout (done 2026-10-26)
Four legacy files were removed after checks showed the build does not use them: `ui/build.mjs` (old esbuild script; it would have
written an inconsistent `dist/`), `ui/src/components.tsx` (replaced by `ui/src/components/`), `ui/src/overview.tsx` (replaced by
`ui/src/views/GameLibrary.tsx` and `weakestStatus` in `ui/src/capabilities.ts`), and `ui/public/icon.svg` (unreferenced placeholder art).
Checks: an import-graph walk from `index.html` and the tests found these were the only unreachable UI files; every Rust file is reachable
through `mod` declarations; the UI bundle had identical content hashes with and without them.
Left in place on purpose: the Windows Store icon sizes in `src-tauri/icons/` (standard `tauri icon` output, not referenced by
`tauri.conf.json`), and the design-reference PNGs in `docs/design-references/` (`CLAUDE.md` and `PROJECT_SPEC.md` point at
`design-references/` at the repo root, which does not exist; the path in those two files is the mismatch, not the images).

## Next action
1. On Windows: `git fetch`, `git checkout main`, `npm install`, `cargo test --workspace`, `npm run dev`; report what you see.
2. Then the Game Library slice: a `scan_games` Tauri command feeding real scan results and the tick-and-compatibility matrix into
   the Game Library page (replacing the mock data), then the per-game hub.
3. Helldivers 2 Build Manager stays a separate adapter track.
